  Mattermost Gender Inclusive Language Plugin
</h1>

The gender-inclusive-language is a Mattermost Plugin which actively listens (and prohibits) for
language with racist, ableist, sexist, or other exclusionary histories. <br>

> The list of gender-inclusive language ideas we used in our project was built by United Nations
> affiliates, government agencies, multinational organizations and others with the aim of creating
> work environments that embrace equality. You can see the full list by following this
> [link](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/gender-inclusive-language).
